### Hello my name is Ous Bayaa (HI OUS BAYAA)!

I'm a full-stack web developer and I recently joined the coding world because I found myself wanting
to repair the bugs in the programs I used to use at work. The challenge of coding is also fun.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app called Bridges to Prosperity, which is a nonprofit that helps build footbridges in East African communities.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ousbayaa/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have over 200 drawings of different characters
- ðŸš˜ I love the aesthetics of cars and the technology that comes with it
- ðŸŽ¥ Film/TV is a must have at least a few times a week!
