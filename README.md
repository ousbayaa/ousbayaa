### Hello my name is Ous Bayaa (HI OUS BAYAA)!

I'm a full-stack web developer and I recently joined the coding world because I found myself wanting
to repair the bugs in the programs I used to use at work. The challenge of coding is also fun.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app called Bridges to Prosperity, and it's a nonprofit that helps build footbridges in East African communities.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ousbayaa/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have over 200 drawings of different characters
